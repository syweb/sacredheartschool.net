          <p>One of Northern California's most loved holiday home tours returns this December with five elegantly decorated homes in East Sacramento's historic Fabulous Forties neighborhood.</p>
          <p>For 38 years, this popular tour has grown to include nearly 5,000 patrons from throughout northern and central California. The homes showcase elaborate renovation while preserving historic detail, custom interior design and creative holiday decor that is sure to ignite the spirit of the season. Homes on the tour this year range in style from a stately English Colonial to a beautifully remodeled home that was once a (Foundry) factory that produces metal casings.</p>
          <p>The tour begins on 46th Street between J and M Streets (where day-of tickets can be purchased) and winds its way through East Sacramento, ending on 40th Street. You may start at either end for an enjoyable, self-guided walking tour, which takes approximately two hours to complete.</p>
          <p>You may use your ticket for a one-time admittance to each house any time during the tour weekend. Tickets are $25 in advance and $30 the day of the event. Children over the age of one must have a ticket. Advance tickets can be purchased on-line or at a number of fine local retailers until December 1st. Please visit the TICKETS tab located on this site for online purchases or a list of retailers.</p>
          <p>The Holiday Home Tour is a fundraiser that benefits Sacred Heart Parish School, and is organized by the parents of Sacred Heart School.</p>
