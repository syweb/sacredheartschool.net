            <strong><font size="3">2010 Holiday Home Tour of East Sacramento</font></strong><br>
			</p>
            <p>Friday, December 3rd: 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.<br>
            Saturday, December 4th: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.<br>
            Sunday, December 5th: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
          <p>One of Northern California's most loved walking holiday home tours returns this December with five elegantly decorated homes in East Sacramento's historic Fabulous Forties neighborhood. This year, in addition to the five beautifully decorated homes, the library at Sacred Heart's brand new "state-of-the-art" school will also be decorated and on display.</p>
			<p>For 37 years, this popular tour has grown to include nearly 5,000 patrons from throughout northern and central California.  The homes showcase elaborate renovation while preserving historic detail, custom interior design and creative holiday decor that is surely to ignite the spirit of the season. Homes on the tour this year range in style from a quintessential craftsman bungalow to an illustrious The Colonial Revival - Kawamura.</p>
			<p>The tour begins on 43rd Street between J and M Streets and winds its way through East Sacramento ending on 38th Street between J and M Streets. You may start at either end for an enjoyable, self-guided walking tour that will take about two hours to complete. You may use your ticket for a one-time admittance to each house any time during the tour weekend. Tickets are $25 in advance and $30 the day of the event. Children over the age of one must have a ticket.  Advance tickets can be purchased on-line up or at fine retailers until December 2nd.  Click on the tickets tab for more information.
			This fundraiser benefits Sacred Heart Parish School, and is organized by the Parents of Sacred Heart School.</p>
