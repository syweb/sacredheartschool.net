            <font size="3"><strong>The Holiday Home Tour of East Sacramento<br>
            </strong></font><font size="2">A Benefit for Sacred Heart Parish School</font></p>
          <p>Take a self-guided walking tour of five magnificent homes in Sacramento’s 
            Fabulous Forties, decorated for the holidays by top interior designers 
            and florists. The tour takes about two hours from start to finish. 
          </p>
          <p>The Fabulous Forties East Sacramento is home to a neighborhood that 
            is affectionately referred to as the &quot;Fabulous Forties.&quot; 
            An area bound by J Street and Folsom Boulevard from 38th to 47th Streets, 
            this historic neighborhood boasts wide avenues, sweeping green lawns 
            and large, prewar (pre-WWI and pre-WWII) homes that have housed many 
            of the city’s most prominent residents. </p>
          <p>The neighborhood features grand old houses that were custom built 
            in the early decades of the 20th century, when architects were looking 
            to Europe for design inspiration. As a result, the Fabulous Forties 
            is renowned for its eclectic &quot;Revival&quot; style architecture. 
            Here you find a variety of dwellings: English cottages, Tudor-style 
            homes, Dutch farmhouses, Mediterranean villas, and Craftsman bungalows. 
            No two houses are the same. </p>
          <p>Every year since 1973, residents of the Fabulous Forties have opened 
            their homes to the public for the Holiday Home Tour, a self-guided 
            walking tour that benefits Sacred Heart Parish School in East Sacramento. 
            Thousands of visitors from throughout Northern California and Nevada 
            and beyond come to see special homes and their architecture that create 
            an extraordinary neighborhood. </p>
