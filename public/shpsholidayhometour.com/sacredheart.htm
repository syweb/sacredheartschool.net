          <p>Welcome to our school's most ambitious fundraiser of the year organized 
            by the parents of Sacred Heart. This is the Home Tour's 36th year, 
            but we're proud to say our school has been around a lot longer. </p>
          <p>For over 75 years, Sacred Heart Parish School has supported families 
            in raising their children, and we are proud that our current student 
            body includes third- and fourth-generation students. We started in 
            the Parish Hall in 1934 with 68 students and two teachers. Today, 
            we have our own campus, 320 students and 31 faculty and staff. </p>
          <p>Sacred Heart Parish School has a proud tradition of excellence and 
            has long enjoyed a reputation for being a leader among diocesan schools 
            in academics and athletics. As a community of learners, we educate 
            each child's whole heart, whole soul, whole mind, whole strength. 
            As a community of believers, we grow together in our faith to love 
            God and our neighbors. </p>
          <p>Our credentialed teaching team respects that each student is gifted 
            and that what we teach, and how we teach, empowers them to be successful. 
            Our highly supportive and involved parents create a dynamic home/school 
            partnership. <br>
            Your support helps us maintain quality in our curriculum, compensate 
            our teachers fairly, and preserve our ministry as an affordable blessing 
            for our families. </p>
          <p>Have a blessed Christmas and a happy, peaceful New Year. </p>
          <p>Rev. Msgr. Robert Walton - Pastor<br>
            Mrs Theresa Sparks, Principal - Principal <br>
